To do a silent DIALux setup use the command line parameter "/s" with "setup.exe". The setup will use the "config.ini" file in 
the folder from which the installation executable is run from. To use a different settings file use the command line 
parameter "/s:full path to configuration file" (e.g. "/s:c:\DIALuxSetupConfig.ini). A silent installation will not automatically
do a system reboot if needed. To force the setup to do a reboot use the command line parameter "/r". After a system reboot a logon
with administrative rights is of utmost importance to complete the DIALux installation successful.
